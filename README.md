In this course weâ€™ll be learning about Excel formulas and having a lot of fun while we are at it.

We will start with cell references, and then move on to different types of formulas, functions such as logical functions, text functions, and lookup functions. All the topics have associated Excel workbook resources containing sample problems to solve, puzzles, games, and real-world practice questions to practice on. To conclude, work on a mini-project to build a dashboard for an imaginary software development firm. Happy learning!
